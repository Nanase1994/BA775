Here’s why:\n\n- Size and speed\n  - Excel has a hard row limit (about 1 million rows per sheet) and can get very slow with large formulas or many sheets.\n  - SQL databases and Python data tools are designed to handle large datasets efficiently, using indexing, streaming, and parallel processing.\n\n- Memory and resources\n  - Excel loads data into memory, which means big files can crash or become sluggish.\n  - SQL runs on a database server; Python can process data in chunks or with out-of-core libraries (e.g., Dask) to avoid loading everything at once.\n\n- Reproducibility and automation\n  - Excel often involves manual steps, copy-paste, and ad-hoc formulas, which are easy to break and hard to reproduce.\n  - SQL and Python scripts can be version-controlled, tested, and rerun automatically to produce the same results every time.\n\n- Data integrity and governance\n  - With Excel, multiple copies of the same data can exist in different files, leading to inconsistencies.\n  - A centralized database plus scripted workflows keep a single source of truth and clear provenance.\n\n- Manipulation capabilities\n  - SQL shines at joining large tables, filtering, aggregating, and doing set-based operations efficiently.\n  - Python (with pandas, pyarrow, etc.) is very flexible for cleaning, feature engineering, and complex transformations, especially when logic is iterative.\n\n- Collaboration and sharing\n  - Databases and code-based workflows are easier to share, review, and run in teams.\n  - Excel files are easier for individuals but harder to manage at scale and in production.\n\nWhen to use Excel still:\n- Quick exploration on small datasets\n- Final tweaks or simple dashboards\n- One-off analyses that don’t need repetition\n\nBottom line: for big datasets and scalable, repeatable analysis, SQL and Python are usually the better tools. Use Excel for quick, light tasks, not as the primary tool for large-scale data work."
